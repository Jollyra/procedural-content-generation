#Build Dungeons With Code

An implementation of Bob Nystrom's [dungeon generation algorithm](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2014/12/21/rooms-and-mazes/).

1. Randomly place some rooms
2. Fill the remaining space with a maze
3. Connect each region together by placing doors
4. Trim the passages back making them sparse

##Notes
If the randomly placed rooms are allowed to connect, you can get interesting landscapes.
